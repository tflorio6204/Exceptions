# 4. Operating System

The `OperatingSystem` class below is used to manage files on a computer. 
It has a method `openFile` that takes a file name and returns a `EditableFile` object,
and a method `createFile` that adds a `EditableFile` object to the list of files.

4.1. Currently, if you try to open a non-existent file, it will just create the file.
    Modify the `openFile` method to instead throw an error if the file is not found, with the message:
    "File not found: [name]" (without square brackets).

4.2. The `createFile` method should not allow files with the same name to be created.
    Modify the method to throw an error if a file with the same name already exists, with the message:
    "File already exists: [name]" (without square brackets).
